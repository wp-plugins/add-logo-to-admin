Add a custom logo to your admin header and to your login page.

== Description ==

This plugin allows a user to customize their admin panel by adding their own logo to the header. It also replaces the WordPress logo on the login screen with the same custom logo.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip the add-logo-to-admin.zip file.
2. Upload the `add-logo-to-admin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Go to Settings => Add Logo to Admin and set your options and add the location of your logo.

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

1) How do I add my own logo?

You have two options. You can create your own logo and name it logo.png, then add it to the add-logo-to-admin/images folder. Or you can go to Settings => Add Logo to Admin and add the location of you logo in the appropriate box.

2) How big does my logo need to be?

You can make it any width or height.
